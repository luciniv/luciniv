I'm a CS student interested mostly in UI / UX, application development, game design, and getting real silly with it

### current focuses
- Full-stack web development
- Fathoming that which is Python
- Blender
- Unreal (yes, real)

If you'd like to contact me elsewhere, my username ``luciniv`` is pretty universal
