### Hi, Iâ€™m Chloe ðŸ‘‹
> (she/her) 

I'm a CS student currently working in SWE, learning fullstack web development, and exploring the game development sphere. I strive, in all of my projects, to build tools that support teams and businesses in accomplishing more in less time.

I mainly use Python, React, Node, JavaScript, PHP + AJAX, and HTML/CSS in my projects and contributions. 

### Check out some of my work!
- MailBee, a Discord ticketing application ([GitHub](https://github.com/luciniv/MailBee))
- A WIP analytics dashboard for MailBee (website TBA, [GitHub]()) 
- Hozcol, a not-for-profit community management organization ([website](http://www.hozcol.org/home), [GitHub](https://github.com/luciniv/hozcol-site))

I have a lot more on the way that I'm excited to share soon.
