### Hi, Iâ€™m luciniv ðŸ¦†
> (she/her)

I'm a CS major looking to further my knowledge in any and every category of software and software development. 
</br> New opportunities are welcome, and I'm always up for an exciting project.

### Current Projects
- Discord application development
- Learning front-end software design
- Implementing story and worldbuilding in a responsive, digital format (aka a website of sorts)

If you'd like to contact me elsewhere, my username ``luciniv`` is pretty universal
